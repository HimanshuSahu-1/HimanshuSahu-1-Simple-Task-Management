The app uses optimistic updates for all mutations.
Auth is via magic link email.

# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project simple  and add additional things later when they become necessary.
